# COMP503-Online-Shop-Application
Java assignment for COMP503 Programming 2 2016.

This program provides interaction with an Online Shop, allowing users to select and purchase products from a database. The program implements a Product Recommender Algorithm (PRA) algorithm that recommends related products to the customer based on their purchases. The PRA works by analysing transaction histories from a text file and observing the frequency products are purchased together. Other products with high purchase frequencies alongside the customer's current purchases are added to a list of recommendations.
